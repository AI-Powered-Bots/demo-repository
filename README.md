## ðŸ’­ Food for thought

Can you imagine having an assistant that helps you deal with information overload? Think about how this tool could make your life easier.

SumBot is a tool that was created precisely for this purpose through the automation of conversations in ChatGPT when a new reaction with the bowtie emoji is added in Slack, ChatGPT itself will send a summarized response of the message within the Slack channel.

## :bulb: Why SumBot? 
 
In today's world of information overload, we are often bombarded with lengthy texts and messages. What if there was a solution to this problem that didn't require programming skills? 
We introduce SumBot, a tool that automates the task of summarizing long messages for you. And the best part is, you don't need to be a programmer to use it. This project utilizes three essential tools: the OpenAI API, Slack (where our bot resides), and Zapier for integration.
